# HackYourTraining

Trainings are a good way to raise the bar. With training we could reach people outside of the community.
But trainings are expensive. How can we disrupt classical training with the help of the community?

What about an open source platform to bring together trainers and trainees, removing intermediaries.

We could build pull based training instead of push based training:
- Anybody can register on the platform using Twitter
- Users could create a "request for training" with:
	* a topic
	* a city
	* a speaker
	* optionally a time window
- Other users can see the request and register as "interesting by the this request for training"
- As soon as we reach a certain threshold, a tweet is send to the trainer
- If the trainer follow the link from Twitter, he sees the "request for training" information, he can then provide:
	* some precise date where he's available
	* the total price to reach for the training to happen
- The register users then received an update and can pay if they still want to participate
- In the meantime, a sponsorship request is send to pre-identified local sponsors to provide:
	* food
	* rooms

In exchange they receive free tickets for the training

It's really just a draft, feel free to improve the idea and share with us on slack:
